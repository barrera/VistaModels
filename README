   This repository will contain Vista Architect model libraries and projects.
To create a new area, make a directory then run vista under that directory.  Any data 
you create should stay under the created directory.  You should be able to point at 
libraries in other directories within this repository as well as make modifications 
to elements in those other directories.
   To get started with git using this repository execute:
> git clone git@github.com:jonmcdonald/VistaModels.git
   Documentation on using git can be found at: http://www.git-scm.com/documentation
   Note you will also have to load an ssh key into github (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

A few useful git sequences:

 - To add local changes to the repository
   > git fetch origin
   > git merge origin/master
   > git push origin master

 - To reset your git area to what is on the server.  This will delete any files you've added.
   > git reset --hard HEAD
   > git clean -f -d
   > git pull
   Note that git clean will accept a path and only clean that path.

 - To add all of your new files and then update from the repository, taking the repository as the correct file.
   You will loose any changes you have made that conflict with what is in the repository.
   First commit your local changes
   > git add *
   > git commit -a -m "Comment for committed file set"
   Next fetch from the repository and overwrite any local conflicts
   > git fetch origin master
   > git merge -s recursive -X theirs origin/master
